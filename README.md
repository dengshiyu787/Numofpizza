# Numofpizza
Storing the data of the number of people coming to me for pizza from 31/03/2020.

Input eveyday's new data then the program will automatically update the excel file, and draw a plot and pie plot to show the dataset clearly.

This is just a simple program, and the reason of my updating is that this is the first time I use pandas/numpy/plt to solve a problem of my own.
